4. Move to the project `cd simple-gcp-image-server`
5. `composer install`

    1. Rename `src/settings.php.example` to `src/settings.php`
    2. Rename `phinx.yml.example` to `phinx.yml`
    3. Edit the config files
6. Run database migrations `vendor/bin/phinx migrate -e development`
7. Run database seeders `vendor/bin/phinx seed:run -e development`

```shell
# Request
http -f POST 'http://localhost:8080/upload' upload-image@~/path/to/image-file

# Response
{
    "serving_url": "http://localhost:8080/_ah/img/encoded_gs_file:YXBwX2RlZmF1bHRfYnVja2V0LzNkMjNmZGJlMWI1OTc2ZmQ0NTM0NjM2Yzc1MDdkZTI5MDllOWRiZTA="
}
```

## Contributing

You can run the service with a [local development server](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/tools/using-local-server), or on GCP.
